# Ifs Lab 4
## Lab Goal
This lab was designed to teach you how to use nested ifs.  

## Lab Description
Given the x and y coordinates of a point in the coordinate plane, print the point and the quadrant in which the point lies. 

 

1) Create a function that returns an integer indicating the quadrant in which the point lies.  

 

2) Write a tester program that tests your function for various points in the coordinate plane.  

 

3) If the point lies on an axis, return 0.
